== Mobile and Web Messaging

The use of mobile devices is increasing and widening. Not only smartphones and 
tablets are connected to Internet but also home devices, car systems, etc. in
the _Internet of Things_.

Even though these devices are increasingly powerful, they still have some 
constraints unknown from desktop computers and servers, they have limited
battery life and intermittent network availability.
They require protocols to communicate with other devices and servers in a 
reliable and efficient way.
The messaging protocols are suited to overcome these constraints and use 
efficiently their most critical resources (network bandwidth and memory usage).

Web applications are increasingly running on these devices. For these
applications too, the messaging protocols can make them more efficient
and responsive.
