== Truck Tracker Messaging Application

[role="lead"]
In this chapter, we present the _Truck Tracker_ application that will be built all along the book.

The application consists in 2 (or 3) components:

* a mobile app (on iOS) that sends the GPS data of the device (the _truck_) and
receive delivery orders
* a Web app (the _control center_) that displays the positions of all the trucks
on a map and can be used to send order to any of them
